Professional Experience
AI
 Software Engineer — ARXOS
2022 – Present - Built multiple LLMRAG-native applications
end-to-end (design → development → deployment), partnering with product, data,
and backend teams. 
·       Implemented a Qur’an interpretation assistant (Ibn Kathir only)
using RAG over curated tafsir content plus a learning-to-rank model to
improve retrieval answer quality; handled Arabic NLP challenges (diacritics,
variants, and query normalization). 
·       Delivered a database “ChartBot” natural-language - SQL
generation with guardrails, returning tables or charts automatically
depending on the question; used LangChain tools, schema-aware prompting, and
RAG over docsmetadata. 
·       Built an agentic survey-filling chatbot that interviews users
conversationally and populates structured forms; added slot-filling,
clarification loops, and validation. 
·       Shipped a WhatsApp AI chatbot for a restaurant chain that answers
customer queries, creates orders, and updates order status via
WhatsApp Business API; integrated with existing order management. 
·       Developed a real-time Friday sermon speech-to-speech translation
pipeline (Arabic - ENURetc.) with ~≤3s latency; prototyped
sign-language support before funding paused. 
·       Created a Smart Contract Manager that ingests emails, matches
them against corporate contracts and policies, detects riskconflicts,
and summarizes findings for the legal team. 
·       Led the AI core in a large Automotive platform (US) dealers
onboard inventory and negotiation rules; a chatbot negotiates prices
with buyers, surfaces financing options by credit score, and schedules test
drives — handoff to dealer without human ops.
o   Improved RAG answer quality by adding a ranking layer on top of
dense retrieval. 
o   Reduced manual order-intake effort for restaurants by moving to conversational
ordering. 
o   Enabled non-technical staff to self-serve analytics via NL → SQL →
chart workflow.
Projects (Details)
·       Qur’an Ibn Kathir RAG — Arabic RAG over tafsir corpus; retrieval hygiene
(chunking & metadata), cross-encoder style reranking, answer
grounding, and citations.
·       DB ChartBot — NL2SQL
with schematool awareness; outputs tables or charts; guardrails to avoid
unsafe queries; explainer traces for generated SQL.
·       Agent Survey Filler — Conversational agent that elicits form fields with
validation and follow-ups; exports to backend APIsDB.
·       WhatsApp Restaurant Bot — Intent + order flow, item availability, order
status; integrated with restaurant backoffice.
·       Friday Sermon Live Translation — Streaming STT → MT → TTS with latency budget;
fallbacks and silenceVAD handling; sign-language PoC.
·       Smart Contract Manager — Email ingestion, policycontract embedding store,
conflictrisk detection and summarization.
·       Automotive Dealer Platform — Dealer onboarding & rules, inventory discovery,
negotiation chatbot, financing, and test-drive scheduling.
